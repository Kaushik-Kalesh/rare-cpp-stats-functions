# rare-mode()-in-C++

C++ doesn't have built-in functions for statistics like to find average/median/mode
Also source code to calculate mode can't also be found in the entire internet! 
Even if its there it will be very rudimentary than this! (stats::mode() can return multiple mode values (if it exists))
You can use these mainly on vectors(which i prefer, than arrays)
Just copy and paste the namespace "stats" and you can start working!
Or copy and paste the functions (average(), median() and mode()) to work in C

Definitions:

Average/Mean - Average/Arithmetic Mean refers to the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.

Median - Arithmetic Median is a positional average and refers to the middle value in a distribution.

Mode - Arithmetic Mode refers to the most frequently occurring value in the data set.
